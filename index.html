<p>The article titled: 
<i>Reasons Why Thai Employees want to join Labor Unions: 
Evidence in Private Companies and State Enterprises</i> was written by <i>Chaturong Napathorn</i> and <i>Suchada Chanprateep</i> and published in the <i>International Journal of Business and Management</i> in December,2011. 
The article focuses on the analysis into the various reasons why employees in Thailand advocate for unionization in their country. In Thailand there are three main job sectors: <strong>agricultural, service, and manufacturing</strong> where labor unions are present. 
In order to develop an understanding behind the reasons members all ranks from nine different unions for nine private companies and two state organizations participated in a combination of interviews and a survey. 
Based on <strong>1841</strong> valid responses from a total of <strong>44573</strong> people the authors determined that there were three main reasons Thai employees want to join the labor union. These reasons are compensation, safeguard against termination without reason and legal consultation for unfair labor practices.</p>

<p>Labor unions in the United States and Europe were primarily established in order to <strong>improve work conditions, career options, and job satisfaction.</strong> Until recently little research has been done into the unionization practices in Asia. The primary reason is that the labor relation climate operates in an autocratic system in which the management controls the labor force. Thai employees in general are not eager to organize into labor unions as a result of this and other cultural factors. Another factor is that the employees often viewing themselves as having a low rank in the workplace and are expected to pay respects to their managers as a result. Establishing a union is seen as creating an adversarial relationship between workers and managers that often puts the job at risk. On the other side most managers have a negative view of unions because they are seen as established for personal gain versus public service.
<strong>Compensation</strong> was the main reason Thai workers wanted to join the labor union. Out of all the questionnaires distributed there were a few statements that had the highest occurrence, but had a ranking core from lowest to highest. The statement with the highest average was that employees joined the labor union because they will have a representative in negotiating salary increases and bonuses. The second ranked statement was that employees joined the labor union because they want someone to help protect their benefits. The lowest ranked statement was that employees want to join the labor union because they believed that the union will protect it’s members long-term benefits helping them to retire. As a result of the ranking most Thai employees that participated in the study agree that salary and bonuses are they key to imporving their daily lives and well being. This is a double-edged sword for the labor unions as their strength is dependent on the number of members in the unions.
<br><br> In a negotiation if the employer offers a substantial wage to the worker the union is seen as powerful and more employees will join increasing it’s strength, however if the negotiations fail employees will not join and those that have already joined will revoke their membership because the fees will be viewed more as a burden rather than a benefit.
The second reason Thai workers wanted to join labor unions was to employ a safeguard against termination without cause. During economic crises many companies ad factories especially in export sector will dismiss a number of employees in order to reduce labor costs and survive the crises. Some of the companies that closed down did so without notifying the employees in advance and a result the employees went on strike. This creates a greater conflict between the workers, employers, and the unions as the employer is seen as exploiting the worker and the union is responsible for either protecting the worker against wrongful termination or offer alternatives that still allow them to work and provide for themselves and their family. One of the key criticisms of labor unions in general is they often protect their interests before they are concerned about the worker and has ultimately been their downfall as history has proven. This is especially the case during strikes as they could either negotiate a fair salary that leaves all sides satisfied or they could bankrupt a company and employees could lose their jobs.
The third reason Thai employees joined the labor union was that the labor union acted as legal consultant in regards to labor law matters such as<strong> insurance, salary, bonuses</strong>, etc. However it was apparent that the greater number of Thai employees do not normally participate in labor relations unless it pertains to their own employment. Any issue related to their employment it is believed that the labor union will act on their behalf to address issues. 
In conclusion the three main reasons Thai employees in this study joined unions are because of <strong>compensation, protection, and legal counsel.</strong></p>

<div id="critique">
<p>The article overall was well written and researched. The authors performed numerous interviews with presidents, members, and employees of both the employers and the unions and and involved enough people that they had a good sample size to determine reasons why the majority of the population in the specific sectors would want to join a labor union. 
It also touched on the issue of regardless of what country a labor union established itself in the primary issue will always involve <strong>salary</strong> and negotiations for what is considered fair for the employers to combat <strong>labor costs</strong> and to ensure employees can provide for themselves and their family. 
The only critique is that although the study was well researched and implemented the issue that is being researched only applies to those organizations that allow labor unions and most of those study has suggested are in service and manufacturing jobs. 
Although it is a large part of the economy in Thailand I’m curious to know about the sectors such as contract, part time, and white collar jobs. My opinion is that the more labor intensive a job is the greater need for a union because of the greater risk of worker exploitation. 
The labor-intensive part of these jobs could also be the result of standing on their feet all day within humid environment with little to no time to rest. 
I agree that labor unions have their place and function in the workplace as they help employees against unfair work conditions and unsustainable wages. 
However a few investments from the companies and factories can reduce the stress of labor unions and ultimately prevent employee strikes when the companies cannot sustain the cost. 
My suggestion would be to invest in low-cost <strong>padded flooring</strong> or <strong>cushioned footwear</strong>to alleviate <strong>joint pain</strong> from standing all day and to invest in <strong>industrial fans</strong> to cool the overall temperature in a humid environment. 
They could also allow music/local news to be played during the day to alleviate boredom during the workday. 
I believe that this would not require a sizeable investment from the company and could actually <strong>reduce labor costs</strong> and <strong>potential turnover</strong> by improving the overall <strong>work conditions</strong> freeing the unions to <strong>negotiate</strong> and maintain a fair salary for the employees and the employer to maintain and grow the business.</p>
